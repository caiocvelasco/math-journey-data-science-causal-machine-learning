Hi, Iâ€™m Caio Velasco ðŸ‘‹. Mechanical Engineer from Brazil with a Masterâ€™s in Economics & Public Policy (UCLA), thanks to a full scholarship from the [Lemann Foundation](https://fundacaolemann.org.br/en/partners/universities/). In 2021, I stepped away from a PhD in Economics in the Netherlands to support my family during the pandemic and redirected my focus fully toward Data Science.

I work at the intersection of **engineering, economics, and data**â€”spanning Business Analysis, Consulting, Analytics Engineering, and Data Science across the **US, UK, Spain, and Brazil**. I enjoy turning messy, fragmented systems into robust **end-to-end data platforms** and pairing that with **mathematical depth** (statistics, econometrics, and causal ML) to drive real-world impact and avoid the correlation vs. causation dilemma.

## What Iâ€™m doing now
- Building an open book: **Foundations of Data Science & Causal ML: A Mathematical Journey** (mathematical rigor + applications).
- Helping teams modernize their stacks (ingestion â†’ modeling with **dbt** â†’ warehouses like **Snowflake/Redshift** â†’ governance & **Looker** dashboards).
- Deepening foundations in **real analysis, probability, statistics,** and **causal inference** to support future research.

## Selected highlights
- Awards & scholarships from **Yale University**, **UCLA**, **GE Foundation**, **Lemann Foundation**, and **The Club of Rome**.
- Early career: helped build **Stone Payments (NASDAQ: STNE)** in Brazil from scratch and founded **MePrepara**, an online math prep platform with **140+ videos** supporting low-income Brazilian students.

## Focus areas
- **Data & Analytics Engineering:** Python Â· SQL Â· dbt Â· Snowflake/Redshift Â· AWS Â· Looker Â· best practices for modeling, tests, CI/CD.
- **Stat/ML & Causality:** mathematical statistics, econometrics, causal inference.
- **Education:** writing clear, didactic materials; mentoring; building bridges between theory and practice.

## Values & approach
- **Rigor + practicality.** Start from first principles, then ship value.
- **Clarity.** Well-structured code and always documentating the process didacticaly.
- **Impact.** Data and technology as tools to expand opportunityâ€”because education changed my life.
