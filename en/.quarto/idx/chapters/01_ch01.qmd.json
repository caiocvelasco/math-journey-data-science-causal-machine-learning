Proofs in analysis, probability, and statistics rely on the ability to manipulate statements rigorously, understand how they combine, and know when two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nFor example, in **Causal Machine Learning**, assumptions are often stated in logical form. For example:\n\n> *If ignorability holds, then a treatment effect is identifiable.*\n\nThus, before diving into analysis and probability, we establish a foundation in logic and set theory. This is important to **formalize assumptions, express mathematical objects precisely, and build proofs with rigor**.\n\nLogic gives us the language **to connect premises and conclusions**, while Set Theory gives us **the structure to define universes of discourse, events, and probability spaces**. Together, they form the toolkit we need **to reason about identification, estimation, and inference**, not only in Causal Machine Learning, but also in Data Science, AI, and any other field that depend on mathematics.\n\n\n## 1.1 Statements, Propositions, Predicates, and Connectives\n\n**💡Motivation**\\\nLearning statements and connectives is like learning the **alphabet of mathematics**.\\\n- If you cannot distinguish valid statements, you cannot even *start* a proof.\n\n*Example in causal inference:*\\\n- $p$: “Treatment is randomized.”\\\n- $q$: “Ignorability holds.”\\\n- Then “If treatment is randomized, then ignorability holds” is $p \\to q$.\n\nWithout connectives, we’d stay in informal language. With them, **we can formalize statements and reason rigorously about consequences**, such as proving that a set of assumptions implies consistency of an estimator, showing that ignorability implies identification of a treatment effect, or demonstrating that conditional independence leads to factorization of a probability distribution into simpler components.\n\nA **Statement** (or **Proposition**) is a declarative sentence that is either *true* or *false*.\n\n-   Example: “3 is even” (false), “Barcelona is in Spain” (true).\n\nA **Predicate** is like a “template” for a statement: it depends on a variable and becomes a statement once you specify the value. For example:\\\n$P(x): x > 0$\\\n- $P(2)$ → “2 \\> 0” (true).\\\n- $P(-1)$ → “-1 \\> 0” (false).\n\n**Connectives** let us combine assumptions systematically. Logical connectives let us build compound statements:\n\n-   Negation: $\\lnot p$ (“not $p$”)\\\n-   Conjunction: $p \\land q$ (“$p$ and $q$”)\\\n-   Disjunction: $p \\lor q$ (“$p$ or $q$”)\\\n-   Conditional: $p \\to q$ (“if $p$ then $q$”)\\\n-   Biconditional: $p \\leftrightarrow q$ (“$p$ if and only if $q$”)\n\nThus:\\\n-   **Predicate**: *general template* (open sentence, truth depends on a variable) -\\> becomes true or false only when a variable is given a value.\\\n-   **Proposition/statement**: *instance of that template* (closed sentence, definite truth) -\\> something that is already true or false.\\\n-   **Connectives**: *operators* that take simple propositions and form compound propositions.\n\n## 1.2 Truth Tables\n\n**💡Motivation** Truth tables are the **grammar checker** of logic.\\\n- They allow us to test whether two statements are equivalent (so we can swap one for another in a proof, probably to make life easier).\\\n- They reveal tautologies (always true) and contradictions (always false).\\\n- They give a mechanical way to check validity of deductive arguments.\n\n*Example in statistics:*\\\n- “If the data behave nicely (i.i.d. + finite variance), then the sample mean is reliable (it will converge to the true mean)” ($p \\to q$).\\\n- Equivalent contrapositive: “If effect is not identifiable, then ignorability does not hold” ($\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$).\\\n- Truth tables prove these are the same, so you can flip perspectives safely in a paper.\n\nA **truth table** shows how the truth value of a compound statement depends on its parts.\n\n**Example:** Prove that an implication ($p \\to q$) is equivalent ($\\equiv$) to its contrapositive ($\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$).\n\nWe want to show: $p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$\n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\to q$ | $\\lnot q$ | $\\lnot p$ | $\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$ |\n|-----|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| T   | T   | T         | F         | F         | T                     |\n| T   | F   | F         | T         | F         | F                     |\n| F   | T   | T         | F         | T         | T                     |\n| F   | F   | T         | T         | T         | T                     |\n\nSince the last two columns match, the implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n**The Basic Connectives**\n\nLogical connectives are rules for combining simpler statements into compound ones.  \nHere are the five most common and some intuition:\n\n---\n\n**Negation: $\\lnot p$ (“not $p$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** Negation flips the truth value.  \n  - If $p$ is true, $\\lnot p$ is false.  \n  - If $p$ is false, $\\lnot p$ is true.  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It is raining.”  \n  $\\lnot p$: “It is not raining.”  \n\n---\n\n**Conjunction: $p \\land q$ (“$p$ and $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\land q$ is true only if **both** $p$ and $q$ are true.  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It is raining.”  \n  $q$: “I am carrying an umbrella.”  \n  $p \\land q$: “It is raining **and** I am carrying an umbrella.”  \n\n- **Truth check:** If either part fails, the whole conjunction is false.  \n\n---\n\n**Disjunction: $p \\lor q$ (“$p$ or $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\lor q$ is true if **at least one** of $p, q$ is true.  \n  (This is the **inclusive or** used in logic.)  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “I will drink coffee.”  \n  $q$: “I will drink tea.”  \n  $p \\lor q$: “I will drink coffee or tea (or both).”  \n\n- **Note:** In everyday language, “or” can be exclusive. Logic defaults to inclusive.  \n\n---\n\n**Conditional: $p \\to q$ (“if $p$ then $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** An implication is false **only** when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.  \n  **In all other cases, it is true.**  \n  Equivalent form:  \n  $$\n  p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot p \\lor q\n  $$  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It rains.”  \n  $q$: “The ground is wet.”  \n  $p \\to q$: “If it rains, then the ground is wet.”  \n\n- **Case analysis:**\\  \n  - If it rains **and** the ground is wet → the statement “If it rains, then the ground is wet” has been **kept**. Both the condition and the consequence hold, so the implication is **true**.  \n  - If it rains **but** the ground is not wet → the statement has been **broken**. This is the **only case** where an implication is false: the condition was met but the promised result failed.  \n  - If it doesn’t rain → the statement never gets a chance to be tested. We cannot accuse it of being false, because the condition (“it rains”) never happened. By definition, logic treats this as **vacuously true**: the promise has not been broken, since there was nothing to check.  \n  - If it doesn’t rain **and** the ground is wet → still vacuously true. The implication didn’t say what should happen when it doesn’t rain; the ground being wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a bucket of water, etc.) doesn’t violate the promise.\n\n**Intuition and goal of the conditional**\n\nThe statement $p \\to q$ is read \"if $p$ *holds* then $q$ *holds*\" or even \"if $p$ is *true* then $q$ is *true*.\"\\  \nAt first glance, this seems strange because we must also handle cases when $p$ or $q$ are false.\\  \nWhy not just say it means “both $p$ and $q$ are true”?  \n\nThe key is that an implication is really a **promise** or **rule**:  \n- “Whenever $p$ happens, $q$ must also happen.”  \n\nSo we only judge the statement in the situations where the promise could actually be tested: **when $p$ is true**.  \n\n- If $p$ is true and $q$ is true  → the promise is kept   → the implication is true.  \n- If $p$ is true and $q$ is false → the promise is broken → the implication is false.  \n\nBut if $p$ is false, the situation that was promised **never arises**. In those cases, the rule is not violated. By convention (and to make logical systems consistent), we treat the implication as **vacuously true** whenever $p$ is false.  \n\nThis explains why the truth table looks the way it does:  \n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\to q$ | Explanation |\n|-----|-----|-----------|-------------|\n| T   | T   | T         | promise kept |\n| T   | F   | F         | promise broken |\n| F   | T   | T         | vacuously true (*condition never triggered*) |\n| F   | F   | T         | vacuously true (*condition never triggered*) |\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nUnderstanding the conditional matters because:  \n\n1. It allows us to **formalize logical rules** like the contrapositive:  \n   $$\n   p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\n   $$\n   which is *central* in proofs.  \n\n2. It prevents confusion when reading theorems:  \n   - “If a sequence converges, then it is bounded” ($p \\to q$).  \n   - This is **not** claiming that all bounded sequences converge; the truth table guarantees the direction of the promise is clear.  \n\n3. It highlights **vacuous truth**, which appears everywhere in math:  \n   - “All unicorns have horns” is technically true, because there are no unicorns to provide a counterexample.  \n   - Similarly, in probability, if an event has probability zero, conditional statements given that event can be vacuously true.  \n\nBy appreciating this structure, the reader sees why the conditional is defined with its somewhat surprising truth table: it captures the idea of a promise that can only be broken in one very specific case.\n\n---\n\n**Biconditional: $p \\leftrightarrow q$ (“$p$ if and only if $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\leftrightarrow q$ is true exactly when $p$ and $q$ have the **same truth value**  \n  (both true or both false).  \n  \n  Equivalent form:  \n  $$\n  p \\leftrightarrow q \\;\\equiv\\; (p \\to q) \\land (q \\to p)\n  $$  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “Today is Saturday.”  \n  $q$: “Tomorrow is Sunday.”  \n  $p \\leftrightarrow q$: “Today is Saturday **if and only if** tomorrow is Sunday.”  \n\n- **Case analysis:**  \n  - If both $p$ and $q$ are true → the biconditional is true (both directions of the promise hold).  \n  - If $p$ is true but $q$ is false → false, because one direction of the “if and only if” fails.  \n  - If $p$ is false but $q$ is true → false, for the same reason.  \n  - If both $p$ and $q$ are false → true, because they match in value (both false).  \n\nThis explains why the truth table looks like this:  \n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\leftrightarrow q$ | Explanation |\n|-----|-----|-----------------------|-------------|\n| T   | T   | T                     | both true → promise kept |\n| T   | F   | F                     | mismatch → one direction fails |\n| F   | T   | F                     | mismatch → one direction fails |\n| F   | F   | T                     | both false → they match |\n\n\n**Intuition and goal of the biconditional**\n\nThe biconditional expresses **equivalence**: $p$ and $q$ “*stand or fall together*.”  \nIt is stronger than a one-way implication: both $p \\to q$ *and* $q \\to p$ must hold.  \n\n- If you read $p \\leftrightarrow q$ aloud, it means:  \n  *“$p$ is true exactly when $q$ is true.”* or *“$p$ holds exactly when $q$ holds.”*\n\nThis is why mathematicians often use “**iff**” (*“if and only if”*) in definitions and theorems:  \n- It guarantees not only that $p$ implies $q$, but also that $q$ implies $p$.  \n\n---\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n1. It formalizes **definitions** in mathematics.  \n   - Example: “A number $n$ is even **iff** $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.”  \n   - This captures both directions: every even number has that form, and every number of that form is even.  \n\n2. It allows us to state **equivalence theorems**.  \n   - Example: “A sequence is Cauchy **iff** it is convergent (in $\\mathbb{R}$).”  \n   - The biconditional captures the deep connection: each property implies the other.  \n\n3. It makes reasoning reversible.  \n   - With an implication, you can only go forward ($p \\to q$).  \n   - With a biconditional, you can go forward and backward: knowing either $p$ or $q$ tells you the other.  \n\nBy mastering the biconditional, the reader understands why mathematicians love the phrase “if and only if”: it’s the precise way of stating **true equivalence** between concepts.\n\n**Summary Table of Connectives**\n\n| Connective | Symbol | Rule (when true) |\n|------------|--------|------------------|\n| Negation   | $\\lnot p$ | when $p$ is false |\n| Conjunction | $p \\land q$ | when $p$ and $q$ are true |\n| Disjunction | $p \\lor q$ | when at least one of $p, q$ is true |\n| Conditional | $p \\to q$ | false only if $p$ true and $q$ false |\n| Biconditional | $p \\leftrightarrow q$ | when $p$ and $q$ have same truth value |\n\n## 1.3 Tautologies, Contradictions, and Logical Equivalence\n\n**Tautology**\n\n**Definition:**  \nA **tautology** is a statement that is true in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Tautologies act like **universal truths**: they don’t depend on data or assumptions.  \n- They are often the “glue” of proofs, showing that certain forms are always valid.  \n- Many rules of inference (like *modus ponens*) are based on tautologies.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\n(p \\land q) \\to p\n$$  \n\nThis means: *If both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true, then \\(p\\) is true.*  \n- Always true, regardless of whether \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) are true or false.  \n\n**Example (statistics):**  \nThe **Law of Total Probability** is tautological:  \n\n$$\nP(A) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A \\cap \\lnot B).\n$$  \n\nThis identity always holds by construction, no matter what events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are.  \n\n---\n\n**Contradiction**\n\n**Definition:**  \nA **contradiction** is a statement that is false in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Contradictions are the **engine** of *proof by contradiction*.  \n- If assuming something leads to a contradiction, then the assumption must be false.  \n- They represent “impossible situations” in logic.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\np \\land \\lnot p\n$$  \n\nThis means: *\\(p\\) is true and \\(p\\) is false at the same time.*  \n- Always false, no matter what truth value \\(p\\) has.  \n\n**Example (statistics):**  \nSuppose we assume:  \n1. “The variance of this distribution is finite.”  \n2. “The variance of this distribution is infinite.”  \n\nTogether, these form a contradiction, so at least one assumption must be wrong.  \n\n---\n\n**Logical Equivalence**\n\n**Definition:**  \nTwo statements are **logically equivalent** if they have the same truth value in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Logical equivalence lets us **replace one statement with another** in a proof.  \n- Many powerful proof strategies rely on equivalence (contrapositive law, De Morgan’s laws, distributive laws).  \n- Often the equivalent form is much easier to work with.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\np \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot p \\lor q\n$$  \n\nThis means: *“If \\(p\\), then \\(q\\)” is the same as “Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\).”*  \n- This equivalence makes it **easier** to manipulate conditionals in proofs.  \n\n**Example (causal inference):**  \n\n$$\n\\text{Ignorability} \\to \\text{Identifiability}\n$$  \n\nis **logically equivalent** to  \n\n$$\n\\lnot \\text{Identifiability} \\to \\lnot \\text{Ignorability}.\n$$  \n\nSwitching to the contrapositive often makes a proof or argument **simpler**.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Tautologies** give us universal truths to rely on.  \n- **Contradictions** allow us to eliminate false assumptions through contradiction proofs.  \n- **Logical equivalence** lets us restate problems in easier forms without changing meaning.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2. Quantificational Logic {.unnumbered}\n\nIn propositional (sentential) logic, we treated statements as indivisible units: each one was either true or false.  \nBut in mathematics and statistics, we often want to say things about *all numbers* in a set, or claim that *at least one* number has a certain property.  \nThis is where **quantifiers** come in.\n\n---\n\n## 2.1 Predicates and Quantifiers\n\nAs we saw above, a **predicate** is like a sentence with a “blank” — it becomes a full statement only once you plug in a value.  \n\n- Example: $P(x): x > 0$.  \n  - If $x = 2$, then $P(2)$ is the proposition “2 > 0” (true).  \n  - If $x = -3$, then $P(-3)$ is the proposition “-3 > 0” (false).  \n\nWe use **quantifiers** to talk about how many elements **satisfy** a predicate:  \n\n- **Universal quantifier ($\\forall$):**  \n  $\\forall x\\; P(x)$ means “for all $x$, $P(x)$ is true.”  \n\n- **Existential quantifier ($\\exists$):**  \n  $\\exists x\\; P(x)$ means “there exists at least one $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true.”  \n\n**Examples:**  \n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$. (*Every integer squared is nonnegative.*)  \n- $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 = 9$. (*There exists an integer whose square is 9.*)  \n\n## 2.2 Universe of Discourse\n\nThe **universe of discourse** is the set of objects we allow $x$ to vary over.  \nThe truth of a statement depends on it!  \n\n**Example:**  \n\n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$ is true.  \n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 = 2$ is false (no integer squared equals 2).  \n\nIf we didn’t specify whether $x$ ranges over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$ (both interpreted as the **universe of discourse** of each **statement**), the meaning would be ambiguous.  \n\n## 2.3 Truth of Quantified Statements\n\nHow to evaluate quantified statements:  \n\n- $\\forall x\\; P(x)$ is true if *every* $x$ in the universe makes $P(x)$ true.  \n- $\\exists x\\; P(x)$ is true if *at least one* $x$ makes $P(x)$ true.  \n\n### Negations of Quantifiers\n\nNegating quantified statements flips the quantifier:  \n\n$$\n\\lnot (\\forall x\\, P(x)) \\equiv \\exists x\\, \\lnot P(x)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lnot (\\exists x\\, P(x)) \\equiv \\forall x\\, \\lnot P(x)\n$$\n\n**Examples:**  \n\n- “Not all students passed” means “There exists a student who did not pass.”  \n- “There does not exist a unicorn” means “For all $x$, $x$ is not a unicorn.”  \n\n## 2.4 Multiple Quantifiers\n\nOften statements involve more than one quantifier.  \n**The order matters!**\n\n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$  \n  → True, because for every real number $x$, we can pick $y = x+1$.  \n\n- $\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$  \n  → False, because no single real number is greater than *all* real numbers.  \n\n**Tip:** Think of quantifiers as a kind of **game**:  \n- For $\\forall x$, your opponent chooses the worst possible $x$.  \n- For $\\exists y$, you get to respond by picking a suitable $y$.  \n\nThe order decides who gets to “move” first, and the outcome can change completely.  \n\n## 2.5 Why This Matters\n\nQuantifiers appear in almost every mathematical theorem.  \n\n- **Analysis (limits):**  \n  $$\n  \\forall \\epsilon > 0,\\; \\exists \\delta > 0:\\; |x - a| < \\delta \\;\\to\\; |f(x) - L| < \\epsilon\n  $$  \n  (“For every tolerance $\\epsilon$, there exists a closeness $\\delta$ that guarantees the function stays within that tolerance.”)  \n\n- **Statistics:**  \n  - $\\forall n,\\; \\exists \\hat{\\theta}_n:\\; \\hat{\\theta}_n \\to \\theta$ (*There exists an estimator consistent for $\\theta$.*)  \n  - $\\exists$ an unbiased estimator of $\\mu$ (the sample mean).  \n\n- **Causal Inference:**  \n  - $\\forall$ randomized experiments, $\\exists$ an unbiased estimator of the treatment effect.  \n\nQuantifiers are the way mathematics formalizes sweeping claims like “always” and “sometimes,” which are **at the heart** of proofs and assumptions in Causal ML.\n\n---\n\n## 2.6 Exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n1. Decide whether each statement is true or false (universe of discourse: $\\mathbb{Z}$):  \n   - $\\forall x,\\; x^2 \\geq 0$  \n   - $\\exists x,\\; x^2 = 2$  \n\n2. Negate the following statements and simplify:  \n   - $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$  \n   - $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{N},\\; x^2 = 2$  \n\n3. Show that the order of quantifiers matters by proving:  \n   - $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$ is true.  \n   - $\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$ is false.  \n\n4. Write in logical symbols:  \n   - “Every dataset has at least one outlier.”  \n   - “There exists a consistent estimator for every parameter.”  \n\n---\n\n\n## References\n\n-   Velleman, D. J.

Logical connectives let us build compound statements:\n\n-   Negation: $\\lnot p$ (“not $p$”)\\\n-   Conjunction: $p \\land q$ (“$p$ and $q$”)\\\n-   Disjunction: $p \\lor q$ (“$p$ or $q$”)\\\n-   Conditional: $p \\to q$ (“if $p$ then $q$”)\\\n-   Biconditional: $p \\leftrightarrow q$ (“$p$ if and only if $q$”)\n\nThus:\\\n-   **Predicate**: *general template* (open sentence, truth depends on a variable) -\\> becomes true or false only when a variable is given a value.\\\n-   **Proposition/statement**: *instance of that template* (closed sentence, definite truth) -\\> something that is already true or false.\\\n-   **Connectives**: *operators* that take simple propositions and form compound propositions.\n\n## 1.2 Truth Tables\n\n**💡Motivation** Truth tables are the **grammar checker** of logic.\\\n- They allow us to test whether two statements are equivalent (so we can swap one for another in a proof, probably to make life easier).\\\n- They reveal tautologies (always true) and contradictions (always false).\\\n- They give a mechanical way to check validity of deductive arguments.\n\n*Example in statistics:*\\\n- “If the data behave nicely (i.i.d. + finite variance), then the sample mean is reliable (it will converge to the true mean)” ($p \\to q$).\\\n- Equivalent contrapositive: “If effect is not identifiable, then ignorability does not hold” ($\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$).\\\n- Truth tables prove these are the same, so you can flip perspectives safely in a paper.\n\nA **truth table** shows how the truth value of a compound statement depends on its parts.\n\n**Example:** Prove that an implication ($p \\to q$) is equivalent ($\\equiv$) to its contrapositive ($\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$).\n\nWe want to show: $p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$\n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\to q$ | $\\lnot q$ | $\\lnot p$ | $\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p$ |\n|-----|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| T   | T   | T         | F         | F         | T                     |\n| T   | F   | F         | T         | F         | F                     |\n| F   | T   | T         | F         | T         | T                     |\n| F   | F   | T         | T         | T         | T                     |\n\nSince the last two columns match, the implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n**The Basic Connectives**\n\nLogical connectives are rules for combining simpler statements into compound ones.  \nHere are the five most common and some intuition:\n\n---\n\n**Negation: $\\lnot p$ (“not $p$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** Negation flips the truth value.  \n  - If $p$ is true, $\\lnot p$ is false.  \n  - If $p$ is false, $\\lnot p$ is true.  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It is raining.”  \n  $\\lnot p$: “It is not raining.”  \n\n---\n\n**Conjunction: $p \\land q$ (“$p$ and $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\land q$ is true only if **both** $p$ and $q$ are true.  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It is raining.”  \n  $q$: “I am carrying an umbrella.”  \n  $p \\land q$: “It is raining **and** I am carrying an umbrella.”  \n\n- **Truth check:** If either part fails, the whole conjunction is false.  \n\n---\n\n**Disjunction: $p \\lor q$ (“$p$ or $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\lor q$ is true if **at least one** of $p, q$ is true.  \n  (This is the **inclusive or** used in logic.)  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “I will drink coffee.”  \n  $q$: “I will drink tea.”  \n  $p \\lor q$: “I will drink coffee or tea (or both).”  \n\n- **Note:** In everyday language, “or” can be exclusive. Logic defaults to inclusive.  \n\n---\n\n**Conditional: $p \\to q$ (“if $p$ then $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** An implication is false **only** when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.  \n  **In all other cases, it is true.**  \n  Equivalent form:  \n  $$\n  p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot p \\lor q\n  $$  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “It rains.”  \n  $q$: “The ground is wet.”  \n  $p \\to q$: “If it rains, then the ground is wet.”  \n\n- **Case analysis:**\\  \n  - If it rains **and** the ground is wet → the statement “If it rains, then the ground is wet” has been **kept**. Both the condition and the consequence hold, so the implication is **true**.  \n  - If it rains **but** the ground is not wet → the statement has been **broken**. This is the **only case** where an implication is false: the condition was met but the promised result failed.  \n  - If it doesn’t rain → the statement never gets a chance to be tested. We cannot accuse it of being false, because the condition (“it rains”) never happened. By definition, logic treats this as **vacuously true**: the promise has not been broken, since there was nothing to check.  \n  - If it doesn’t rain **and** the ground is wet → still vacuously true. The implication didn’t say what should happen when it doesn’t rain; the ground being wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a bucket of water, etc.) doesn’t violate the promise.\n\n**Intuition and goal of the conditional**\n\nThe statement $p \\to q$ is read \"if $p$ *holds* then $q$ *holds*\" or even \"if $p$ is *true* then $q$ is *true*.\"\\  \nAt first glance, this seems strange because we must also handle cases when $p$ or $q$ are false.\\  \nWhy not just say it means “both $p$ and $q$ are true”?  \n\nThe key is that an implication is really a **promise** or **rule**:  \n- “Whenever $p$ happens, $q$ must also happen.”  \n\nSo we only judge the statement in the situations where the promise could actually be tested: **when $p$ is true**.  \n\n- If $p$ is true and $q$ is true  → the promise is kept   → the implication is true.  \n- If $p$ is true and $q$ is false → the promise is broken → the implication is false.  \n\nBut if $p$ is false, the situation that was promised **never arises**. In those cases, the rule is not violated. By convention (and to make logical systems consistent), we treat the implication as **vacuously true** whenever $p$ is false.  \n\nThis explains why the truth table looks the way it does:  \n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\to q$ | Explanation |\n|-----|-----|-----------|-------------|\n| T   | T   | T         | promise kept |\n| T   | F   | F         | promise broken |\n| F   | T   | T         | vacuously true (*condition never triggered*) |\n| F   | F   | T         | vacuously true (*condition never triggered*) |\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nUnderstanding the conditional matters because:  \n\n1. It allows us to **formalize logical rules** like the contrapositive:  \n   $$\n   p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\n   $$\n   which is *central* in proofs.  \n\n2. It prevents confusion when reading theorems:  \n   - “If a sequence converges, then it is bounded” ($p \\to q$).  \n   - This is **not** claiming that all bounded sequences converge; the truth table guarantees the direction of the promise is clear.  \n\n3. It highlights **vacuous truth**, which appears everywhere in math:  \n   - “All unicorns have horns” is technically true, because there are no unicorns to provide a counterexample.  \n   - Similarly, in probability, if an event has probability zero, conditional statements given that event can be vacuously true.  \n\nBy appreciating this structure, the reader sees why the conditional is defined with its somewhat surprising truth table: it captures the idea of a promise that can only be broken in one very specific case.\n\n---\n\n**Biconditional: $p \\leftrightarrow q$ (“$p$ if and only if $q$”)**\n\n- **Rule:** $p \\leftrightarrow q$ is true exactly when $p$ and $q$ have the **same truth value**  \n  (both true or both false).  \n  \n  Equivalent form:  \n  $$\n  p \\leftrightarrow q \\;\\equiv\\; (p \\to q) \\land (q \\to p)\n  $$  \n\n- **Example:**  \n  $p$: “Today is Saturday.”  \n  $q$: “Tomorrow is Sunday.”  \n  $p \\leftrightarrow q$: “Today is Saturday **if and only if** tomorrow is Sunday.”  \n\n- **Case analysis:**  \n  - If both $p$ and $q$ are true → the biconditional is true (both directions of the promise hold).  \n  - If $p$ is true but $q$ is false → false, because one direction of the “if and only if” fails.  \n  - If $p$ is false but $q$ is true → false, for the same reason.  \n  - If both $p$ and $q$ are false → true, because they match in value (both false).  \n\nThis explains why the truth table looks like this:  \n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\leftrightarrow q$ | Explanation |\n|-----|-----|-----------------------|-------------|\n| T   | T   | T                     | both true → promise kept |\n| T   | F   | F                     | mismatch → one direction fails |\n| F   | T   | F                     | mismatch → one direction fails |\n| F   | F   | T                     | both false → they match |\n\n\n**Intuition and goal of the biconditional**\n\nThe biconditional expresses **equivalence**: $p$ and $q$ “*stand or fall together*.”  \nIt is stronger than a one-way implication: both $p \\to q$ *and* $q \\to p$ must hold.  \n\n- If you read $p \\leftrightarrow q$ aloud, it means:  \n  *“$p$ is true exactly when $q$ is true.”* or *“$p$ holds exactly when $q$ holds.”*\n\nThis is why mathematicians often use “**iff**” (*“if and only if”*) in definitions and theorems:  \n- It guarantees not only that $p$ implies $q$, but also that $q$ implies $p$.  \n\n---\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n1. It formalizes **definitions** in mathematics.  \n   - Example: “A number $n$ is even **iff** $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.”  \n   - This captures both directions: every even number has that form, and every number of that form is even.  \n\n2. It allows us to state **equivalence theorems**.  \n   - Example: “A sequence is Cauchy **iff** it is convergent (in $\\mathbb{R}$).”  \n   - The biconditional captures the deep connection: each property implies the other.  \n\n3. It makes reasoning reversible.  \n   - With an implication, you can only go forward ($p \\to q$).  \n   - With a biconditional, you can go forward and backward: knowing either $p$ or $q$ tells you the other.  \n\nBy mastering the biconditional, the reader understands why mathematicians love the phrase “if and only if”: it’s the precise way of stating **true equivalence** between concepts.\n\n**Summary Table of Connectives**\n\n| Connective | Symbol | Rule (when true) |\n|------------|--------|------------------|\n| Negation   | $\\lnot p$ | when $p$ is false |\n| Conjunction | $p \\land q$ | when $p$ and $q$ are true |\n| Disjunction | $p \\lor q$ | when at least one of $p, q$ is true |\n| Conditional | $p \\to q$ | false only if $p$ true and $q$ false |\n| Biconditional | $p \\leftrightarrow q$ | when $p$ and $q$ have same truth value |\n\n## 1.3 Tautologies, Contradictions, and Logical Equivalence\n\n**Tautology**\n\n**Definition:**  \nA **tautology** is a statement that is true in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Tautologies act like **universal truths**: they don’t depend on data or assumptions.  \n- They are often the “glue” of proofs, showing that certain forms are always valid.  \n- Many rules of inference (like *modus ponens*) are based on tautologies.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\n(p \\land q) \\to p\n$$  \n\nThis means: *If both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true, then \\(p\\) is true.*  \n- Always true, regardless of whether \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) are true or false.  \n\n**Example (statistics):**  \nThe **Law of Total Probability** is tautological:  \n\n$$\nP(A) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A \\cap \\lnot B).\n$$  \n\nThis identity always holds by construction, no matter what events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are.  \n\n---\n\n**Contradiction**\n\n**Definition:**  \nA **contradiction** is a statement that is false in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Contradictions are the **engine** of *proof by contradiction*.  \n- If assuming something leads to a contradiction, then the assumption must be false.  \n- They represent “impossible situations” in logic.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\np \\land \\lnot p\n$$  \n\nThis means: *\\(p\\) is true and \\(p\\) is false at the same time.*  \n- Always false, no matter what truth value \\(p\\) has.  \n\n**Example (statistics):**  \nSuppose we assume:  \n1. “The variance of this distribution is finite.”  \n2. “The variance of this distribution is infinite.”  \n\nTogether, these form a contradiction, so at least one assumption must be wrong.  \n\n---\n\n**Logical Equivalence**\n\n**Definition:**  \nTwo statements are **logically equivalent** if they have the same truth value in *all possible cases*.  \n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Logical equivalence lets us **replace one statement with another** in a proof.  \n- Many powerful proof strategies rely on equivalence (contrapositive law, De Morgan’s laws, distributive laws).  \n- Often the equivalent form is much easier to work with.  \n\n**Example (logic):**  \n\n$$\np \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot p \\lor q\n$$  \n\nThis means: *“If \\(p\\), then \\(q\\)” is the same as “Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\).”*  \n- This equivalence makes it **easier** to manipulate conditionals in proofs.  \n\n**Example (causal inference):**  \n\n$$\n\\text{Ignorability} \\to \\text{Identifiability}\n$$  \n\nis **logically equivalent** to  \n\n$$\n\\lnot \\text{Identifiability} \\to \\lnot \\text{Ignorability}.\n$$  \n\nSwitching to the contrapositive often makes a proof or argument **simpler**.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Tautologies** give us universal truths to rely on.  \n- **Contradictions** allow us to eliminate false assumptions through contradiction proofs.  \n- **Logical equivalence** lets us restate problems in easier forms without changing meaning.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2. Quantificational Logic {.unnumbered}\n\nIn propositional (sentential) logic, we treated statements as indivisible units: each one was either true or false.  \nBut in mathematics and statistics, we often want to say things about *all numbers* in a set, or claim that *at least one* number has a certain property.  \nThis is where **quantifiers** come in.\n\n---\n\n## 2.1 Predicates and Quantifiers\n\nAs we saw above, a **predicate** is like a sentence with a “blank” — it becomes a full statement only once you plug in a value.  \n\n- Example: $P(x): x > 0$.  \n  - If $x = 2$, then $P(2)$ is the proposition “2 > 0” (true).  \n  - If $x = -3$, then $P(-3)$ is the proposition “-3 > 0” (false).  \n\nWe use **quantifiers** to talk about how many elements **satisfy** a predicate:  \n\n- **Universal quantifier ($\\forall$):**  \n  $\\forall x\\; P(x)$ means “for all $x$, $P(x)$ is true.”  \n\n- **Existential quantifier ($\\exists$):**  \n  $\\exists x\\; P(x)$ means “there exists at least one $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true.”  \n\n**Examples:**  \n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$. (*Every integer squared is nonnegative.*)  \n- $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 = 9$. (*There exists an integer whose square is 9.*)  \n\n## 2.2 Universe of Discourse\n\nThe **universe of discourse** is the set of objects we allow $x$ to vary over.  \nThe truth of a statement depends on it!  \n\n**Example:**  \n\n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$ is true.  \n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 = 2$ is false (no integer squared equals 2).  \n\nIf we didn’t specify whether $x$ ranges over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$ (both interpreted as the **universe of discourse** of each **statement**), the meaning would be ambiguous.  \n\n## 2.3 Truth of Quantified Statements\n\nHow to evaluate quantified statements:  \n\n- $\\forall x\\; P(x)$ is true if *every* $x$ in the universe makes $P(x)$ true.  \n- $\\exists x\\; P(x)$ is true if *at least one* $x$ makes $P(x)$ true.  \n\n### Negations of Quantifiers\n\nNegating quantified statements flips the quantifier:  \n\n$$\n\\lnot (\\forall x\\, P(x)) \\equiv \\exists x\\, \\lnot P(x)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lnot (\\exists x\\, P(x)) \\equiv \\forall x\\, \\lnot P(x)\n$$\n\n**Examples:**  \n\n- “Not all students passed” means “There exists a student who did not pass.”  \n- “There does not exist a unicorn” means “For all $x$, $x$ is not a unicorn.”  \n\n## 2.4 Multiple Quantifiers\n\nOften statements involve more than one quantifier.  \n**The order matters!**\n\n- $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$  \n  → True, because for every real number $x$, we can pick $y = x+1$.  \n\n- $\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$  \n  → False, because no single real number is greater than *all* real numbers.  \n\n**Tip:** Think of quantifiers as a kind of **game**:  \n- For $\\forall x$, your opponent chooses the worst possible $x$.  \n- For $\\exists y$, you get to respond by picking a suitable $y$.  \n\nThe order decides who gets to “move” first, and the outcome can change completely.  \n\n## 2.5 Why This Matters\n\nQuantifiers appear in almost every mathematical theorem.  \n\n- **Analysis (limits):**  \n  $$\n  \\forall \\epsilon > 0,\\; \\exists \\delta > 0:\\; |x - a| < \\delta \\;\\to\\; |f(x) - L| < \\epsilon\n  $$  \n  (“For every tolerance $\\epsilon$, there exists a closeness $\\delta$ that guarantees the function stays within that tolerance.”)  \n\n- **Statistics:**  \n  - $\\forall n,\\; \\exists \\hat{\\theta}_n:\\; \\hat{\\theta}_n \\to \\theta$ (*There exists an estimator consistent for $\\theta$.*)  \n  - $\\exists$ an unbiased estimator of $\\mu$ (the sample mean).  \n\n- **Causal Inference:**  \n  - $\\forall$ randomized experiments, $\\exists$ an unbiased estimator of the treatment effect.  \n\nQuantifiers are the way mathematics formalizes sweeping claims like “always” and “sometimes,” which are **at the heart** of proofs and assumptions in Causal ML.\n\n---\n\n## 2.6 Exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n1. Decide whether each statement is true or false (universe of discourse: $\\mathbb{Z}$):  \n   - $\\forall x,\\; x^2 \\geq 0$  \n   - $\\exists x,\\; x^2 = 2$  \n\n2. Negate the following statements and simplify:  \n   - $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; x^2 \\geq 0$  \n   - $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{N},\\; x^2 = 2$  \n\n3. Show that the order of quantifiers matters by proving:  \n   - $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$ is true.  \n   - $\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}: y > x$ is false.  \n\n4. Write in logical symbols:  \n   - “Every dataset has at least one outlier.”  \n   - “There exists a consistent estimator for every parameter.”  \n\n---\n\n\n## References\n\n-   Velleman, D. J.
