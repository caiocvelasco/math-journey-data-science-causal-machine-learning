    "text": "World 1 — The Statistics and Econometrics Tradition\n(Model → Inference)\nDid you know that when you run a regression, you are implicitly making a strong claim about how the world works?\nIn this tradition, everything begins with the data-generating process (DGP) — what Aris Spanos in Probability Theory and Statistical Inference calls a stochastic mechanism. Imagine it as a hidden machine tossing probabilistic dice, producing the data we observe.\nA statistical model is not just a tool; it’s a story about that hidden mechanism — a simplified mathematical narrative about how outcomes arise.\nExamples:\n- A linear regression assumes wages, test scores, or prices are generated as a straight-line combination of inputs plus random noise.\n- A Poisson model assumes counts follow a specific probabilistic law.\n- A time-series AR(1) assumes today’s value depends on yesterday’s, plus a random shock.\nIf the DGP is hidden, what do we do? — We try to uncover its truth.\nThat’s why introductory statistics begins with the idea of a Population and then introduces Samples. Since we can’t observe the whole population, we rely on probabilistic laws like the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to argue that sample averages approximate population truths.\nFrom here arises Inference:\n&gt; If I trust my assumptions about the DGP, I can use my sample to make representative claims about the population.\nThis is the heart of classical statistics and econometrics:\n1. Model the hidden process.\n2. Estimate its parameters.\n3. Test whether your story holds up against data.\nBut remember: the DGP is always an assumption. If it’s wrong, inference can mislead.",

    "text": "0. Mathematics, Axioms, and Science\nMathematics begins with axioms — assumptions we agree to accept without proof — and builds everything else from them using precise rules of logic.\nThis process of axiomatization is what gives mathematics its unique clarity: starting from simple, explicit principles, we construct entire theories.\nWhy is this important?\n- Axioms are not “true” in an absolute sense. They are starting points.\n- What matters is whether the consequences drawn from them are logically consistent and useful for understanding the world.\n- In practice, this makes mathematics a language in which science can express and test ideas.\nMathematics provides the rigorous framework for turning assumptions into predictions.\nFor example, in Euclidean geometry we assume as an axiom:\nBut this depends on the “space” we are working in.\nIntuitively:\nNow consider two points on the equator that are exactly opposite each other (say Rio de Janeiro and Jakarta).\nThe key idea is that “straight line” really means shortest possible path given the geometry of the space.\nOn a plane, that’s the familiar straight line; on a sphere, it’s a great circle.\nThe notion of a geodesic generalizes this idea: whatever the space, it tells us the natural way to connect two points as efficiently as possible.\nThis illustrates a key point:\nThey are conventions that define the system we are working in.\nWithin their proper context (e.g., Euclidean geometry), their consequences are logically consistent (no contradictions arise) and useful (for designing buildings, maps, and bridges). But in other contexts (e.g., spherical geometry), we need a different set of axioms.\nIn the same way, in probability we may assume:\nReal-world data often violates this (dependence in time series, non-identical distributions in heterogeneous populations).\nBut within the i.i.d. framework, the consequences are logically consistent and extremely useful: they give us fundamental results like the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nThe analogy with geometry is this:\nSimilarly, in probability:\nWhy we begin with Logic and Set Theory\nTogether, Logic and Set Theory form the grammar and vocabulary of mathematics.\nThey are not yet “about the real world” — but they give us the precise tools to state assumptions and derive consequences.\nIntuition for research\nWhen you see theoretical work in physics, economics, or causal machine learning, it often starts by axiomatizing the problem:\n- Define the objects (e.g. random variables, causal spaces).\n- Specify assumptions as axioms (e.g. independence, stability, interventions).\n- Derive results rigorously from there.\nBy starting here, we are learning how to speak the language of mathematics before applying it to inference, probability, and causality.\nThus, before diving into analysis and probability, we establish a foundation in logic and set theory. This is important to formalize assumptions, express mathematical objects precisely, and build proofs with rigor.\nLogic gives us the language to connect premises and conclusions, while Set Theory gives us the structure to define universes of discourse, events, functions, probability spaces, etc.\nTherefore: Yes, it would be essential to learn Logic and Set Theory!",

    "text": "1.1 Statements, Propositions, Predicates, and Connectives\n💡Motivation\nLearning statements and connectives is like learning the alphabet of mathematics.\n- If you cannot distinguish valid statements, you cannot even start a proof.\nExample in causal inference:\n- \\(p\\): “The model includes all relevant confounders.”\n- \\(q\\): “The conditional independence assumption holds.”\n- Then “If the model includes all relevant confounders, then the conditional independence assumption holds” is \\(p \\to q\\).\nWithout connectives, we’d stay in informal language. With them, we can formalize statements and reason rigorously about consequences, such as proving that a set of assumptions implies consistency of an estimator, showing that ignorability implies identification of a treatment effect, or demonstrating that conditional independence leads to factorization of a probability distribution into simpler components.\nA Statement (or Proposition) is a declarative sentence that is either true or false.\n\nExample: “3 is even” (false), “Barcelona is in Spain” (true).\n\nA Predicate is like a “template” for a statement: it depends on a variable and becomes a statement once you specify the value. For example:\n\\(P(x): x &gt; 0\\) (this is a Predicate or a “template”)\n- \\(P(2)\\) → “2 &gt; 0” (This is a Statement, with logic value “true”).\n- \\(P(-1)\\) → “-1 &gt; 0” (This is a Statement, with logic value “false”).\nConnectives are logical “operators” that allow us to combine simple statements into more complex ones.\nThey let us reason systematically instead of relying on vague language.\nBut why do we want to combine simple statements into more complex ones?\nBecause in mathematics (and especially in statistics), we rarely deal with isolated facts.\nWe deal with assumptions and want to know what conclusions they imply.\nConnectives give us the structure to move from “pieces of information” to a logical argument.\nExample from statistics:\n\n\\(p\\): “The sample is i.i.d.”\n\n\\(q\\): “The variance of the sample is finite.”\n\n\\(r\\): “The sample mean converges to the true mean (Law of Large Numbers).”\n\nIn words:\n“If the sample is i.i.d. and the variance is finite, then the sample mean converges.”\nSymbolically:\n\\[\n(p \\land q) \\to r\n\\]\nThis is exactly how many theorems are written: conditions (joined with \\(\\land\\)) imply a result (\\(\\to\\)).\nSo connectives are not just about making compound sentences longer.\nThey are about giving us a precise language of assumptions and consequences.\n\nThis is the foundation of mathematical reasoning: once we can formalize, we can prove.\n\nLet’s see them one by one with examples:\n\nNegation (\\(\\lnot p\\))\nMeaning: “not \\(p\\)”\n\nIf \\(p\\) is: “The number 5 is even” (false),\n\nThen \\(\\lnot p\\) is: “The number 5 is not even” (true).\n\n\n\n\nConjunction (\\(p \\land q\\))\nMeaning: “\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)” → true only when both are true.\n\n\\(p\\): “2 is even” (true)\n\n\\(q\\): “3 is prime” (true)\n\n\\(p \\land q\\): “2 is even and 3 is prime” (true).\n\nIf either part were false, the whole conjunction would be false.\n\n\n\n\nDisjunction (\\(p \\lor q\\))\nMeaning: “\\(p\\) or \\(q\\)” → true if at least one is true.\n\n\\(p\\): “Barcelona is in Spain” (true)\n\n\\(q\\): “Lisbon is in Brazil” (false)\n\n\\(p \\lor q\\): “Barcelona is in Spain or Lisbon is in Brazil” (true).\n\n(Note: In logic, “or” usually means inclusive or — at least one true, possibly both.)\n\n\n\nConditional (\\(p \\to q\\))\nMeaning: “if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)” → false only if \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false.\n\n\\(p\\): “It rains.”\n\n\\(q\\): “The ground is wet.”\n\n\\(p \\to q\\): “If it rains, then the ground is wet.”\n\nTrue if it rains and the ground is wet (promise kept).\n\nFalse if it rains but the ground is not wet (promise broken).\n\nTrue if it doesn’t rain (vacuously true).\n\n\n\n\n\nBiconditional (\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\))\nMeaning: “\\(p\\) if and only if \\(q\\)” → true when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth value.\n\n\\(p\\): “Today is Saturday.”\n\n\\(q\\): “Tomorrow is Sunday.”\n\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\): “Today is Saturday if and only if tomorrow is Sunday.” → true.\n\nIf one part is true and the other false, the biconditional is false.\n\n\nThus:\n- Predicate: general template (open sentence, truth depends on a variable) -&gt; becomes true or false only when a variable is given a value.\n- Proposition/statement: instance of that template (closed sentence, definite truth) -&gt; something that is already true or false.\n- Connectives: operators that take simple propositions and form compound propositions.",

    "section": "1.2 Truth Tables",
    "text": "1.2 Truth Tables\n💡Motivation\nNow that we know connectives allow us to combine assumptions and conclusions into structured arguments, we need a way to check the consistency and behavior of these arguments.\nWhy? Because once statements get more complex, our intuition alone isn’t reliable.\nFor example, the conditional \\(p \\to q\\) often confuses beginners. Why? Because in everyday language, “if… then…” feels different from how logic defines it.\nThe Concept of “Promise”\n\nWe naturally read a conditional like \\(p \\to q\\) as: “If it rains, then the ground gets wet.”\nThink of \\(p \\to q\\) as a promise:\n\n\\(p\\): It rains.\n\n\\(q\\): The ground gets wet.\n\nSo \\(p \\to q\\) means: “I promise that if it rains, then the ground will get wet.”\nWe also naturally think that:\n1. If it rains and the ground is wet → ✅ promise kept.\n2. If it rains and the ground is not wet → ❌ promise broken.\nSo far, this matches intuition.\nBut what if it doesn’t rain?\n- Logic says: the conditional is still true, no matter whether the ground is wet or dry.\n- Why? Because the promise “if it rains, then the ground gets wet” has not been broken — the condition (\\(p\\)) never happened in the first place.\n- This is what we call vacuous truth.\nThis feels counterintuitive, and that’s exactly why we need a systematic tool.\nWhy Truth Tables?\nTruth tables are the grammar checker of logic. They resolve this confusion:\n\nThey let us mechanically verify whether compound statements are valid, equivalent, tautological, or contradictory.\n\nThey are a first step toward building formal proofs, because they allow us to test the “mechanics” of logical structure before tackling deeper arguments.\n\nThink of them as a microscope for logical statements:\nwhen connectives weave sentences together, truth tables let us zoom in and see all possible truth scenarios at once.\nThey also let us test whether two statements are logically equivalent. For example:\n\n“If not \\(p\\), then not \\(q\\).”\n\n“If \\(q\\), then \\(p\\).”\n\nAre these equivalent? Intuition may fail, but a Truth Table makes it crystal clear!\nExample in statistics:\n\nIf the data behave nicely (i.i.d. + finite variance), then the sample mean is reliable (it will converge to the true mean) (\\(p \\to q\\)).\n\nContrapositive: If the sample mean does not converge to the true mean, then the data were not i.i.d. with finite variance (\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)).\n\nA truth table shows how the truth value of a compound statement depends on its parts.\nExample: Prove that an implication (\\(p \\to q\\)) is equivalent (\\(\\equiv\\)) to its contrapositive (\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)).\nWe want to show: \\(p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\to q\\)\n\\(\\lnot q\\)\n\\(\\lnot p\\)\n\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nT\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nT\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n\nSince the last two columns match, the implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.\nExample: Analysis of a Conditional\nTake \\(p\\): It rains, and \\(q\\): The ground gets wet.\nThe statement \\(p \\to q\\) is a promise: “If it rains, then the ground gets wet.”\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\to q\\)\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\n✅ promise kept\n\n\nT\nF\nF\n❌ promise broken\n\n\nF\nT\nT\nvacuously true (condition never triggered)\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nvacuously true (condition never triggered)\n\n\n\nKey intuition:\n- An implication is only false when the condition happens but the promised result fails.\n- In all other cases, the promise has not been broken, so the implication is true.\nThis is why statements like “All unicorns have horns” are technically true: since there are no unicorns, the condition never triggers, and the statement cannot be falsified.\n\n\nExercises\n\nExercise 1. Show that \\(p \\to q\\) is equivalent to \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\).\nStep 1. Write the two statements side by side: \\(p \\to q\\) and \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\).\nStep 2. Build a truth table with columns for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(\\lnot p\\), \\(p \\to q\\), and \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\).\nStep 3. Compare the last two columns.\nStep 4. Conclude: if they match in all rows, the statements are logically equivalent.\n\nSolution\n\nStep 1: Write the two statements side by side: \\(p \\to q\\) and \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\).\nWhat we want to check is whether these two always mean the same thing.\n- \\(p \\to q\\): “If \\(p\\), then \\(q\\).”\n- \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\): “Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\).”\nAt first sight they look different, but we suspect they are really saying the same thing.\nTo confirm, we will compare their truth tables row by row.\n\nStep 2: Build a truth table with columns for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(\\lnot p\\), \\(p \\to q\\), and \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\).\n(Didactic hint: to fill this correctly, recall the “grammar” of each connective.)\n- Negation \\(\\lnot p\\): flips the truth value (T→F, F→T).\n- Disjunction \\(A \\lor B\\): true if at least one of \\(A,B\\) is true.\n- Conditional \\(p \\to q\\): think “promise” — it is false only when the promise is broken (i.e., \\(p\\) is T but \\(q\\) is F); otherwise true (including when \\(p\\) is F: vacuous truth).\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(\\lnot p\\)\n\\(p \\to q\\)\n\\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\)\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n\nHow we filled it:\n- \\(\\lnot p\\) is just the flip of \\(p\\).\n- \\(p \\to q\\) is only F in the row \\((p,q)=(T,F)\\) (promise broken).\n- \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\) is true when either \\(\\lnot p\\) is T or \\(q\\) is T.\n\nStep 3: Compare the last two columns.\nThe columns for \\(p \\to q\\) and \\(\\lnot p \\lor q\\) are identical (T, F, T, T).\nTherefore, the statements have the same truth value in every case.\n\nStep 4: Conclude.\nWe conclude:\n\\(p \\to q \\equiv \\lnot p \\lor q\\)\nIn words: an implication “if \\(p\\), then \\(q\\)” always carries the same meaning as saying “either \\(p\\) does not happen, or \\(q\\) happens.”\n\n\nExercise 2. Analyze the statement: “If a number is divisible by 4, then it is even.”\nStep 1. Define \\(p\\): “number is divisible by 4”, and \\(q\\): “number is even.”\nStep 2. Translate into logic: \\(p \\to q\\).\nStep 3. Think through cases:\n- A number divisible by 4 (say 12) → it is even → promise kept.\n- A number divisible by 4 but not even → impossible case → promise broken.\n- A number not divisible by 4 (say 9) → nothing promised, implication vacuously true.\nStep 4. Verify with a truth table if needed.\nStep 5. Conclude: the statement holds logically.\n\nBiconditional: \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) (“\\(p\\) if and only if \\(q\\)”)\n\nRule: \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is true exactly when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth value\n(both true or both false).\nEquivalent form:\n\\[\np \\leftrightarrow q \\;\\equiv\\; (p \\to q) \\land (q \\to p)\n\\]\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “Today is Saturday.”\n\\(q\\): “Tomorrow is Sunday.”\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\): “Today is Saturday if and only if tomorrow is Sunday.”\nCase analysis:\n\nIf both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true → the biconditional is true (both directions of the promise hold).\n\nIf \\(p\\) is true but \\(q\\) is false → false, because one direction of the “if and only if” fails.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is false but \\(q\\) is true → false, for the same reason.\n\nIf both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are false → true, because they match in value (both false).\n\n\nThis explains why the truth table looks like this:\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nboth true → promise kept\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nmismatch → one direction fails\n\n\nF\nT\nF\nmismatch → one direction fails\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nboth false → they match\n\n\n\nIntuition and goal of the biconditional\nThe biconditional expresses equivalence: \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) “stand or fall together.”\nIt is stronger than a one-way implication: both \\(p \\to q\\) and \\(q \\to p\\) must hold.\n\nIf you read \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) aloud, it means:\n“\\(p\\) is true exactly when \\(q\\) is true.” or “\\(p\\) holds exactly when \\(q\\) holds.”\n\nThis is why mathematicians often use “iff” (“if and only if”) in definitions and theorems:\n- It guarantees not only that \\(p\\) implies \\(q\\), but also that \\(q\\) implies \\(p\\).\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIt formalizes definitions in mathematics.\n\nExample: “A number \\(n\\) is even iff \\(n = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).”\n\nThis captures both directions: every even number has that form, and every number of that form is even.\n\nIt allows us to state equivalence theorems.\n\nExample: “A sequence is Cauchy iff it is convergent (in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)).”\n\nThe biconditional captures the deep connection: each property implies the other.\n\nIt makes reasoning reversible.\n\nWith an implication, you can only go forward (\\(p \\to q\\)).\n\nWith a biconditional, you can go forward and backward: knowing either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) tells you the other.\n\n\nBy mastering the biconditional, the reader understands why mathematicians love the phrase “if and only if”: it’s the precise way of stating true equivalence between concepts.\nSummary Table of Connectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnective\nSymbol\nRule (when true)\n\n\n\n\nNegation\n\\(\\lnot p\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) is false\n\n\nConjunction\n\\(p \\land q\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true\n\n\nDisjunction\n\\(p \\lor q\\)\nwhen at least one of \\(p, q\\) is true\n\n\nConditional\n\\(p \\to q\\)\nfalse only if \\(p\\) true and \\(q\\) false\n\n\nBiconditional\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have same truth value",

    "text": "2.6 Mathematical Interpretation\nQuantifiers can look intimidating at first, but the real skill is learning how to read them.\nEvery quantified statement has two parts:\n1. the quantifier (\\(\\forall\\) or \\(\\exists\\)), and\n2. the predicate (a property of \\(x\\) that is claimed to hold).\n\n2.6.1 Single Quantifier Examples\n\nUniversal (\\(\\forall\\)):\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; x^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\nRead: “For every real number \\(x\\), the square of \\(x\\) is nonnegative.”\nInterpretation: This is true, because no real number squared gives a negative result.\nStatistics example:\n\\[\n\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N},\\; \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_n) \\geq 0\n\\]\nRead: “For every sample size \\(n\\), the variance of the sample mean is nonnegative.”\nInterpretation: Always true, because variances can never be negative.\n\n\n\nExistential (\\(\\exists\\)):\n\\[\n\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\; x^2 = 4\n\\]\nRead: “There exists an integer whose square is 4.”\nInterpretation: True, since \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\) work.\nStatistics example:\n\\[\n\\exists \\;\\text{an estimator } \\hat{\\theta}\\; : \\; \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\theta}] = \\theta\n\\]\nRead: “There exists an estimator whose expected value equals the true parameter.”\nInterpretation: This is the definition of an unbiased estimator (e.g., the sample mean for \\(\\mu\\)).\n\n\n2.6.2 Multiple Quantifier Examples\nWhen quantifiers are combined, order matters.\n\nExample 1:\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\; y &gt; x\n\\]\nRead: “For every real number \\(x\\), there exists a real number \\(y\\) that is greater than \\(x\\).”\nTrue, because if someone hands you any \\(x\\), you can always respond with \\(y = x+1\\).\nStatistics example:\n\\[\n\\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0,\\; \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}:\\; n &gt; N \\;\\to\\; |\\bar{X}_n - \\mu| &lt; \\epsilon\n\\]\nRead: “For every tolerance \\(\\epsilon\\), there exists a large enough sample size \\(N\\) such that if \\(n &gt; N\\), the sample mean is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(\\mu\\).”\nInterpretation: This is the definition of consistency (Law of Large Numbers).\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\\[\n\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\; y &gt; x\n\\]\nRead: “There exists a real number \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\) is greater than every real number \\(x\\).”\nFalse, because no single real number is larger than all others.\nStatistics example (false statement):\n\\[\n\\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N},\\; \\forall n &gt; N:\\; \\bar{X}_n = \\mu\n\\]\nRead: “There exists a finite sample size \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\), the sample mean equals the population mean exactly.”\nFalse, because sampling variation never completely disappears — the sample mean only converges in probability, not with exact equality at some \\(N\\).\n\n\n2.6.3 How to Think About Multiple Quantifiers\nA useful way to think is as a game:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\) = your opponent picks a value of \\(x\\), possibly trying to make you fail.\n\n\\(\\exists y\\) = you get to respond by picking \\(y\\) to satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the statement\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\; y &gt; x\n\\]\nmeans: No matter what \\(x\\) your opponent picks, you can always respond with a suitable \\(y\\).\nBut the reverse order\n\\[\n\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{R},\\; \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\; y &gt; x\n\\]\nmeans: You must pick one \\(y\\) that beats all possible \\(x\\). This is impossible, so the statement is false.\n\nWhy this section is important\nQuantifiers are everywhere in math, stats, and causal ML.\n\nUniversal quantifiers express generality:\n\n“For all sample sizes \\(n\\), \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_n) \\geq 0\\).”\n\n“For all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists an \\(N\\) such that …” (limits, consistency).\n\nExistential quantifiers express possibility:\n\n“There exists an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mu\\).”\n\n“There exists a consistent estimator for every parameter.”\n\nWith multiple quantifiers, the order of ‘who chooses first’ changes the meaning dramatically.\nThis interpretative skill is essential for reading theorems correctly and avoiding misinterpretation.",
