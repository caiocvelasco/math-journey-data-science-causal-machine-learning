    "text": "1. Sentential Logic\nMathematical Reasoning begins with logic. Proofs in analysis, probability, and statistics rely on the ability to manipulate statements rigorously, understand how they combine, and know when two statements are logically equivalent.\nFor example, in Causal Machine Learning, assumptions are often stated in logical form. For example:\nThus, before diving into analysis and probability, we establish a foundation in logic and set theory. This is important to formalize assumptions, express mathematical objects precisely, and build proofs with rigor.\nLogic gives us the language to connect premises and conclusions, while Set Theory gives us the structure to define universes of discourse, events, and probability spaces. Together, they form the toolkit we need to reason about identification, estimation, and inference, not only in Causal Machine Learning, but also in Data Science, AI, and any other field that depend on mathematics.",

    "text": "1.1 Statements, Propositions, Predicates, and Connectives\n💡Motivation\nLearning statements and connectives is like learning the alphabet of mathematics.\n- If you cannot distinguish valid statements, you cannot even start a proof.\nExample in causal inference:\n- \\(p\\): “Treatment is randomized.”\n- \\(q\\): “Ignorability holds.”\n- Then “If treatment is randomized, then ignorability holds” is \\(p \\to q\\).\nWithout connectives, we’d stay in informal language. With them, we can formalize statements and reason rigorously about consequences, such as proving that a set of assumptions implies consistency of an estimator, showing that ignorability implies identification of a treatment effect, or demonstrating that conditional independence leads to factorization of a probability distribution into simpler components.\nA Statement (or Proposition) is a declarative sentence that is either true or false.\n\nExample: “3 is even” (false), “Barcelona is in Spain” (true).\n\nA Predicate is like a “template” for a statement: it depends on a variable and becomes a statement once you specify the value. For example:\n\\(P(x): x &gt; 0\\)\n- \\(P(2)\\) → “2 &gt; 0” (true).\n- \\(P(-1)\\) → “-1 &gt; 0” (false).\nConnectives let us combine assumptions systematically. Logical connectives let us build compound statements:\n\nNegation: \\(\\lnot p\\) (“not \\(p\\)”)\n\nConjunction: \\(p \\land q\\) (“\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)”)\n\nDisjunction: \\(p \\lor q\\) (“\\(p\\) or \\(q\\)”)\n\nConditional: \\(p \\to q\\) (“if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)”)\n\nBiconditional: \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) (“\\(p\\) if and only if \\(q\\)”)\n\nThus:\n- Predicate: general template (open sentence, truth depends on a variable) -&gt; becomes true or false only when a variable is given a value.\n- Proposition/statement: instance of that template (closed sentence, definite truth) -&gt; something that is already true or false.\n- Connectives: operators that take simple propositions and form compound propositions.",

    "text": "1.2 Truth Tables\n💡Motivation Truth tables are the grammar checker of logic.\n- They allow us to test whether two statements are equivalent (so we can swap one for another in a proof, probably to make life easier).\n- They reveal tautologies (always true) and contradictions (always false).\n- They give a mechanical way to check validity of deductive arguments.\nExample in statistics:\n- “If the data behave nicely (i.i.d. + finite variance), then the sample mean is reliable (it will converge to the true mean)” (\\(p \\to q\\)).\n- Equivalent contrapositive: “If effect is not identifiable, then ignorability does not hold” (\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)).\n- Truth tables prove these are the same, so you can flip perspectives safely in a paper.\nA truth table shows how the truth value of a compound statement depends on its parts.\nExample: Prove that an implication (\\(p \\to q\\)) is equivalent (\\(\\equiv\\)) to its contrapositive (\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)).\nWe want to show: \\(p \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\to q\\)\n\\(\\lnot q\\)\n\\(\\lnot p\\)\n\\(\\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\\)\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nT\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nT\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n\nSince the last two columns match, the implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.\nThe Basic Connectives\nLogical connectives are rules for combining simpler statements into compound ones.\nHere are the five most common and some intuition:\n\nNegation: \\(\\lnot p\\) (“not \\(p\\)”)\n\nRule: Negation flips the truth value.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is true, \\(\\lnot p\\) is false.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is false, \\(\\lnot p\\) is true.\n\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “It is raining.”\n\\(\\lnot p\\): “It is not raining.”\n\n\nConjunction: \\(p \\land q\\) (“\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)”)\n\nRule: \\(p \\land q\\) is true only if both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true.\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “It is raining.”\n\\(q\\): “I am carrying an umbrella.”\n\\(p \\land q\\): “It is raining and I am carrying an umbrella.”\nTruth check: If either part fails, the whole conjunction is false.\n\n\nDisjunction: \\(p \\lor q\\) (“\\(p\\) or \\(q\\)”)\n\nRule: \\(p \\lor q\\) is true if at least one of \\(p, q\\) is true.\n(This is the inclusive or used in logic.)\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “I will drink coffee.”\n\\(q\\): “I will drink tea.”\n\\(p \\lor q\\): “I will drink coffee or tea (or both).”\nNote: In everyday language, “or” can be exclusive. Logic defaults to inclusive.\n\n\nConditional: \\(p \\to q\\) (“if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)”)\n\nRule: An implication is false only when \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false.\nIn all other cases, it is true.\nEquivalent form:\n\\[\np \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot p \\lor q\n\\]\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “It rains.”\n\\(q\\): “The ground is wet.”\n\\(p \\to q\\): “If it rains, then the ground is wet.”\nCase analysis: \n\nIf it rains and the ground is wet → the statement “If it rains, then the ground is wet” has been kept. Both the condition and the consequence hold, so the implication is true.\n\nIf it rains but the ground is not wet → the statement has been broken. This is the only case where an implication is false: the condition was met but the promised result failed.\n\nIf it doesn’t rain → the statement never gets a chance to be tested. We cannot accuse it of being false, because the condition (“it rains”) never happened. By definition, logic treats this as vacuously true: the promise has not been broken, since there was nothing to check.\n\nIf it doesn’t rain and the ground is wet → still vacuously true. The implication didn’t say what should happen when it doesn’t rain; the ground being wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a bucket of water, etc.) doesn’t violate the promise.\n\n\nIntuition and goal of the conditional\nThe statement \\(p \\to q\\) is read “if \\(p\\) holds then \\(q\\) holds” or even “if \\(p\\) is true then \\(q\\) is true.”  At first glance, this seems strange because we must also handle cases when \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) are false.  Why not just say it means “both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true”?\nThe key is that an implication is really a promise or rule:\n- “Whenever \\(p\\) happens, \\(q\\) must also happen.”\nSo we only judge the statement in the situations where the promise could actually be tested: when \\(p\\) is true.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is true → the promise is kept → the implication is true.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false → the promise is broken → the implication is false.\n\nBut if \\(p\\) is false, the situation that was promised never arises. In those cases, the rule is not violated. By convention (and to make logical systems consistent), we treat the implication as vacuously true whenever \\(p\\) is false.\nThis explains why the truth table looks the way it does:\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\to q\\)\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\npromise kept\n\n\nT\nF\nF\npromise broken\n\n\nF\nT\nT\nvacuously true (condition never triggered)\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nvacuously true (condition never triggered)\n\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nUnderstanding the conditional matters because:\n\nIt allows us to formalize logical rules like the contrapositive:\n\\[\np \\to q \\;\\equiv\\; \\lnot q \\to \\lnot p\n\\] which is central in proofs.\nIt prevents confusion when reading theorems:\n\n“If a sequence converges, then it is bounded” (\\(p \\to q\\)).\n\nThis is not claiming that all bounded sequences converge; the truth table guarantees the direction of the promise is clear.\n\nIt highlights vacuous truth, which appears everywhere in math:\n\n“All unicorns have horns” is technically true, because there are no unicorns to provide a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly, in probability, if an event has probability zero, conditional statements given that event can be vacuously true.\n\n\nBy appreciating this structure, the reader sees why the conditional is defined with its somewhat surprising truth table: it captures the idea of a promise that can only be broken in one very specific case.\n\nBiconditional: \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) (“\\(p\\) if and only if \\(q\\)”)\n\nRule: \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is true exactly when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth value\n(both true or both false).\nEquivalent form:\n\\[\np \\leftrightarrow q \\;\\equiv\\; (p \\to q) \\land (q \\to p)\n\\]\nExample:\n\\(p\\): “Today is Saturday.”\n\\(q\\): “Tomorrow is Sunday.”\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\): “Today is Saturday if and only if tomorrow is Sunday.”\nCase analysis:\n\nIf both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true → the biconditional is true (both directions of the promise hold).\n\nIf \\(p\\) is true but \\(q\\) is false → false, because one direction of the “if and only if” fails.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is false but \\(q\\) is true → false, for the same reason.\n\nIf both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are false → true, because they match in value (both false).\n\n\nThis explains why the truth table looks like this:\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)\n\\(q\\)\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nboth true → promise kept\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nmismatch → one direction fails\n\n\nF\nT\nF\nmismatch → one direction fails\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nboth false → they match\n\n\n\nIntuition and goal of the biconditional\nThe biconditional expresses equivalence: \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) “stand or fall together.”\nIt is stronger than a one-way implication: both \\(p \\to q\\) and \\(q \\to p\\) must hold.\n\nIf you read \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) aloud, it means:\n“\\(p\\) is true exactly when \\(q\\) is true.” or “\\(p\\) holds exactly when \\(q\\) holds.”\n\nThis is why mathematicians often use “iff” (“if and only if”) in definitions and theorems:\n- It guarantees not only that \\(p\\) implies \\(q\\), but also that \\(q\\) implies \\(p\\).\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIt formalizes definitions in mathematics.\n\nExample: “A number \\(n\\) is even iff \\(n = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).”\n\nThis captures both directions: every even number has that form, and every number of that form is even.\n\nIt allows us to state equivalence theorems.\n\nExample: “A sequence is Cauchy iff it is convergent (in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)).”\n\nThe biconditional captures the deep connection: each property implies the other.\n\nIt makes reasoning reversible.\n\nWith an implication, you can only go forward (\\(p \\to q\\)).\n\nWith a biconditional, you can go forward and backward: knowing either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) tells you the other.\n\n\nBy mastering the biconditional, the reader understands why mathematicians love the phrase “if and only if”: it’s the precise way of stating true equivalence between concepts.\nSummary Table of Connectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnective\nSymbol\nRule (when true)\n\n\n\n\nNegation\n\\(\\lnot p\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) is false\n\n\nConjunction\n\\(p \\land q\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true\n\n\nDisjunction\n\\(p \\lor q\\)\nwhen at least one of \\(p, q\\) is true\n\n\nConditional\n\\(p \\to q\\)\nfalse only if \\(p\\) true and \\(q\\) false\n\n\nBiconditional\n\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)\nwhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have same truth value",
